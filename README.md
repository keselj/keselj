Welcome to Tic Tac Toe! This is my first solo project, a classic game where you can challenge your friend and see who will emerge victorious in this epic battle of X's and O's.

Important Note: This game features some sarcastic jokes for winners and losers. If you have a good sense of humor and don't mind some playful banter, you'll have a great time playing!

Goals
Connecting React with Solidity using Truffle is one of my current goals, as I believe it will open up exciting possibilities in decentralized applications.
